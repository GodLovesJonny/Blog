Klingon does not have a verb "to be". Instead, pronouns help to fill that role.  
    

For example, **jIH** means "I" or "me" but also means "I am" in sentences such as **tlhIngan jIH** "I am a Klingon".   
    

**ghaH** means "he", "she", "him", or "her" and also means "he is" or "she is" in sentences such as **tlhIngan ghaH** "He is a Klingon" or "She is a Klingon".   
    
    
To specify who the "he", "she", or "it" is, Klingon uses pronouns in combination with a "Type 5" noun suffix **-'e'**. "Torg is a Klingon" is **tlhIngan ghaH torgh'e'**, and "The men are Klingons" is **tlhInganpu' chaH loDpu''e'**.   
    

When using an adjectival verb as a verb, the adjectival verb includes "to be" in the verb. You do not use a pronoun as "to be" when a verbal adjective is acting as the verb. You may still use a pronoun to represent the subject.   
    

When using an adjectival verb as an adjective following the noun it describes, there is no "to be" in the English translation. If you want to use such a noun phrase as the topic in a "pronoun as to be" sentence, the -'e' suffix goes on the end of the whole noun phrase (appearing to attach to the adjectival verb).    
    

Compare:    
+ **val tlhIngan SuvwI'** "The Klingon warrior is smart."
+ **val ghaH** "She is smart."
+ **SuvwI' val** "the smart warrior"
+ **tlhIngan ghaH SuvwI' val'e'** "The smart warrior is a Klingon."
