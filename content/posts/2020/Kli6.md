Meaning is added to Klingon words through use of syllables added to the front or ends of words.   
    

Syllables added to the beginnings of words are called prefixes and in Klingon indicate who is doing a particular verb and who that action is done to.   
    

Suffixes are added to the ends of words and occassionally you will encounter a word with more than one suffix. Klingon linguists categorize these suffixes according to which ones cannot occur together and what order they must occur in. Verbs have 10 suffix types and generally only one suffix can occur from each type, but if you have one from each type, plus a prefix, you can have a very complicated verb!    
    

Nouns have 5 suffix classes and again, you can only have one suffix of each type. Klingon nouns can still get pretty complicated even with only 5 suffixes.    
    

The types of the suffixes are numbered because they may only occur in the order of their numbers. A type 1 suffix must always occur before a type 4 suffix.
