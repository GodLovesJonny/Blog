"This, these" and "that, those" use "Type 4" noun suffixes: **-vam** and **-vetlh**, respectively: **Ha'DIbaHvam** "this animal", **Ha'DIbaHmeyvetlh** "those animals".     
    

Whether "this" or "these" is appropriate as a translation of **-vam** depends on whether the noun is singular or plural; similarly with "that" or "those" for **-vetlh**.   
    

Note that these type 4 endings come after the type 2 plural suffix and **-'e'** would come last as a type 5 suffix.
