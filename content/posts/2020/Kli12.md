Klingon uses the apostrophe ' as a letter.   
    

It does not use the double-quote character " as a letter. When you see what might look like a double-quote in the middle of the word, it is actually two apostrophes side by side.   
    

For example, **maw'** means "to be crazy" or "he/she is crazy"; when you add the question suffix **-'a'** , you get **maw''a'?** "is he/she crazy?".
