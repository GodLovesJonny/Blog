As mentioned in the previous post, nouns are joined with **je**.
    
    
To join two sentences with "and" a different word is used: **'ej**.   
    

This word is placed between the sentences.     
    
    
For example, "I run" (**jIqet**) + "I jump" (**jISup**) can become "I run and I jump" (**jIqet 'ej jISup**).    
    

**'ej** is only for joining sentences or verb phrases together, not nouns -- you cannot say **torgh 'ej mara**, for example.
