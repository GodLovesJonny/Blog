The "Type 5" verb suffix **-laH** indicates "can" or "able to".  
    

For example, it makes the difference between **tlhIngan Hol vIjatlh** "I speak Klingon" and **tlhIngan Hol vIjatlhlaH** "I can speak Klingon".
    

As introduced in [the previous post](https://godlovesjonny.github.io/2020/kli11/), the verb suffix **-be'** means "not".    
    

You may remember that this suffix is classified as a "rover". Unlike suffix types 1-9, some of the rovers can actually be placed in different orders and change the meaning of the sentence slightly based on where they occur.    
    
    
The "rover" suffix **-be'** comes after the verb portion which it negates.   
    

So **tlhIngan Hol vIjatlhlaHbe'** means "I cannot speak Klingon" (the **-be'** negates the **-laH**), while **tlhIngan Hol vIjatlhbe'laH** would mean "I am able to not speak Klingon" (the **-be'** negates the **vIjatlh** to make "I do not speak", and then **-laH** turns that into "I can not-speak" or "I am able not to speak").    
    

The other feature of some of the rovers is that they can appear **multiple times**, thus negating multiple parts of the verb construction.  
    
    
**jIjatlhbe'laHbe'** would mean, "I cannot not speak," or, "I am not able to not speak."    
    

Most verbs have only one or two suffixes at a time, and the correct order of suffixes will soon become second nature from seeing the most frequent combinations.
