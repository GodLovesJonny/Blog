### Notes:
1. In Klingon, case matters. Many letters are always lowercase (even at the beginning of a sentence!) and some are always uppercase.
2. Note **I** (capital i) versus **l** (small L).
3. **Q** and **q** are two separate letters.
4. **ch gh ng tlh** count as single consonants in Klingon.
5. **'** (the apostrophe) also counts as a letter. It represents a glottal stop.
6. Letters **b, l, m, n, p, t, & v** are said as in English, but **b, p, & t** should always have a puff of air, even at the end of a word.
7. Vowels each have one pronunciation. (**a** as in father; **e** as in ten; **I** as in it; **o** as in bowl; **u** as the oo in pool)
8. **I** is uppercase to remind us that it is different from the pattern of 5 vowels we often see in foreign languages. The vowel **I** (capital i) never has an adjacent vowel and the consonant **l** (small L) will always have at least one adjacent vowel.
9. **w & y** are as in English at the beginnings of syllables and form a combined sound called a diphthong at the ends. At the end of a syllable **w** sounds like the vowel **u** while **y** sounds like **ee**. So **paw** sounds like "pow" while **pay** sounds like "pie".
10. **ch** is said as in the English word "church". Never like an English "k" nor "sh".
11. **j** should be said hard like the end of the English word "judge".
12. **'** represents a sound we make a lot in English. We don't usually mark it in English, but in Klingon it is a full letter & leaving it out is like missing any other letter from a word. We call this a **qaghwI'**. It is made by closing the throat and is described as a glottal stop. You can experience it in the middle of the word "uh-oh". That stop between syllables is a glottal stop. You may notice that you also close the throat at the beginning of "uh-oh" and all English words that start with a vowel. The Klingon word **'ej** sounds exactly like the English word "edge".
13. **r** is not usually said at the roof of the mouth like an American English "r", but with the tip of the tongue behind the teeth like a Spanish "r". 
14. **ng** is said exactly as in English, but many English speakers are not used to it at the beginning of a word. Put the back of your tongue to the roof of your mouth to make this sound.
15. **q** sounds much like an English "k", but is said from the back of the throat. The **q** does not include the "w" sound as in English words that begin with "qu" and even when **q** is followed by **u**, the two sounds do not blend. The Klingon word **qul** ("fire") should sound like the English word "cool", but with a stronger "c" sound. This is a different letter than the **Q** which is explained below.
16. **D** in Klingon sounds very similar to the English "d", but should be said with the tip of the tongue further back in the high roof of the mouth and is capitalized to help us remember the difference.
17. **S** is similarly said with the tip of the tongue further back in the high roof of the mouth. It winds up sounding a little bit like an English "sh", but should never be said like an "sh".
18. **gh** is produced at the top of the throat with a raspy gargle or purr and a voiced vibration in the throat.
19. **H** is pronounced in the same position as the **gh** but without the voiced vibration. It is capitalized to remind us not to pronounce it like the weak English "h". When you see a lower-case "h" it will always be part of one of the consonants **ch**, **gh** or **tlh**.
20. **Q** is different than **q**, but it is similar in that it is a sort of a combination of the **q** sound and the **H** sound. It should start with the throat closed like you are going to make a **q**, but then explode into a raspy **H-**type sound.
21. **tlh** is another sound not made in English. It sort of explodes like a "t", but out the sides of the tongue like an "l".
