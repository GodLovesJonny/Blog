English plurals are a good example of using suffixes. In English an -s or an -es is generally added to the end of the noun to make it plural.    
    

Klingon plurals are formed in a similar fashion to the English method of forming plurals. In Klingon a **-pu'**, **-Du'**, or **-mey** is added to the end of the noun.   
    

These are the "Type 2" noun suffixes.   
    

Nearly all Klingon nouns belong to one of three groups, depending on which "Type 2" noun suffix they use to form their plural:    
+ Beings capable of using language have a plural in **-pu'**
+ Body parts have a plural in **-Du'**
+ Everything else (including inanimate objects, robots, and animals) have a plural in **-mey**
    

There are only a handful of exceptions where nouns have completely separate plurals, a bit like English "person / people".   
    

Plural suffixes in Klingon are **optional** and can be left off. A noun without one of these suffixes might still be plural.
