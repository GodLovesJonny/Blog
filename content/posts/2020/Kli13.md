**-'egh** indicates that the subject of the verb affects itself (or the subjects affect themselves). For example, from **legh** (see), one could form **legh'egh torgh** "Torg sees himself" or **legh'egh puqpu'** "the children see themselves" (perhaps in a mirror).   
    

**-chuq** indicates that the subjects of the verb affect each other. It only makes sense if the subject is plural: "we, you, they". For example, **leghchuq puqpu'** would mean "the children see each other" -- that is, each child sees another child.   
    

In more technical terms, the suffix **-'egh** makes a verb **reflexive**, while the suffix **--chuq** makes it **reciprocal**.
