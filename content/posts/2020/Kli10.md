**HISlaH** means "yes" and **ghobe'** means "no".  
    

These words are primarily used to answer yes/no questions.  
    

Besides these two words, **Qo'** is used to express refusal (as in "No, I won't!"). **HIja'** also means "yes" and is a direct synonym with no different connotations.    
    

Note that unlike the English word "no", the words ghobe' and Qo' cannot be used as determiners (as in "We have no bananas."), nor as adverbs ("I am no better."); they are strictly used as exclamations.
