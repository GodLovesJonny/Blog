Klingon verbs do not have tense (past, present, future), so a verb such as **yaj** could mean "understands, understood, will understand".   
     

In grammar, a *subject* is the one doing the action and an *object* is the one the action is done to. Klingon verbs show the *subject* and the *object* of verbs by means of *prefixes*.   
   

The most important verb prefixes are:   
+ **jI-** = I (subject), no object
+ **bI-** = you (subject), no object -- for single person
+ **ma-** = we (subject), no object
+ **Su-** = you (subject), no object -- for multiple people, also some times said as "you guys", "all of you", "you all", or "y'all"
+ **vI-** = I (subject), him/her/it/them (object)
+ **Da-** = you (subject), him/her/it/them (object) -- for single person
+ **lu-** = they (subject), him/her/it (object)
    

If the subject is third person (he/she/it/they) and has either no object or a third-person object (him/her/it/them), then the verb has no prefix. (With the exception of "they - him/her/it")   
So a verb such as yaj can mean "he understands; she understands; it understands; they understand; he understands him/her/it/them; she understands him/her/it/them; they understand them", or the same in the past or future.    
    

Because of the verbal prefixes, the subject and/or object does not have to be included as a pronoun, and subject or object pronouns are often left off.    
    

You will sometimes be presented with an English sentence with the word "you" and no other indication whether this is supposed to be singular or plural. In such cases, Duolingo will usually accept either the Klingon version for singular "you" or for plural "you". But watch carefully for other grammar or context in the exercise that indicates whether the "you" might be singular or plural.
