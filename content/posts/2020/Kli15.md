In the [previous post](https://godlovesjonny.github.io/2020/kli3/), we have introduced the most common verb prefixes: **jI-, vI-, bI-, Da-, ma-, Su-**, and no prefix at all (sometimes called the "null" prefix).   
    

Here we are going to introduce some new verb prefixes for combinations of subjects and objects:   
    

| Prefix   | Subject           | Object             |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **jI-**  | I                 | no object          |
| **vI-**  | I                 | him/her/it/them    |
| **bI-**  | you (singular)    | no object          |
| **Da-**  | you (singular)    | him/her/it/them    |
| **ma-**  | we                | no object          |
| **Su-**  | you (plural)      | no object          |
| **lu-**  | they              | him/her/it         |
|----------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **qa-**  | I                 | you (singular)     |
| **Sa-**  | I                 | you (plural)       |
| **cho-** | you (singular)    | me                 |
| **ju-**  | you (singular)    | us                 |
| **pI-**  | we                | you (singular)     |
| **re-**  | we                | you (plural)       |
| **wI**   | we                | him, her, it       |
| **DI-**  | we                | them               |
| **tu-**  | you (plural)      | me                 |
| **che-** | you (plural)      | us                 |
| **bo-**  | you (plural)      | him, her, it, them |
| **mu-**  | he, she, it, they | me                 |
| **Du-**  | he, she, it       | you (singular)     |
| **nI-**  | they              | you (singular)     |
| **nu-**  | he, she, it, they | us                 |
| **lI-**  | he, she, it, they | you (plural)       |
    

Pay special attention to the fact that when the subject is "we", there are separate prefixes **wI-** and **DI-** depending on whether the third-person object is singular (him, her, it) or plural (them) -- unlike when the subject is "I" (**vI-** for both singular and plural third person subjects) or "you (singular)" (**Da-** for both singular and plural third person subjects) or "you (plural)" (**bo-** for both singular and plural third person subjects). Though this is a constructed language, there are some irregularities like this that appear to make it resemble a natural language.   
        

Some of these prefixes are more frequent then others, especially the ones with an object of "him, her, it" and/or "them".   
    

The others are a bit rarer, though **cho-** and **qa-** (you do something to me, or I do something to you) are perhaps a bit more common than the others.   
    

The prefix system allows both the object and subject to be indicated on the verb itself and because of the specificity of the prefixes, it is often not necessary to specifically state the object and subject with additional explicit objects and subjects. However, if you do want to explicitly state who or what the object or subject is, to make the sentence even more specific or for emphasis, you simply put the name, noun, or pronoun before the verb (if the object) or after the verb (if the subject).
