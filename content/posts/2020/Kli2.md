**nuqneH** is a truncated form of **nuq DaneH**, meaning "What do you want?"   
It is a common misconception that this is "the Klingon word for hello". In fact, Klingons have no word for hello. If a Klingon wishes to say something, they'll walk up to you and say it, without wasting time - as they see it - on idle chatter.  
    

**nuqjatlh?** is a truncated form of **nuq Dajatlh?**, meaning "What did you say?"   
    

**Qapla'** means "success".    
This word is often mistranslated as "Goodbye", due to the fact that it is often heard at the end of conversations. In fact, Klingon has no word for "Goodbye", but **Qapla'** is often used either to congratulate somebody on their success or to wish them success in the future.
