Pronouns can be used to represent a noun. When using pronouns with a verb, you still must include the appropriate prefix : **jIqet jIH** "I run"; **maval maH** "we are smart"; **jIH cholegh SoH** "you see me".   
    

Pronouns can be left off, however, since the verb prefix shows what the subject and object are. The prefixes are required, while the pronouns are not. They are commonly used to emphasise the subject and/or object, for example, **jIqet jIH 'ach bIyIt SoH** "I am running but you are walking".    
    

Since the null prefix is used for many third person subjects and objects, pronouns are also sometimes used to clarify: **mara legh qoq 'ej 'oH tI' ghaH** "The robot sees Mara and she fixes it".    
    
    
### SoH vs. tlhIH
Klingon makes a distinction between "you" when speaking to one person and "you" when speaking to several people. "You" for one person is **SoH**; "you" for several people is **tlhIH**. English sentences that use "you" are often ambiguous -- they could be talking to one person or several -- but Klingon sentences are clear.   
    

There is no distinction, in Klingon, for formality or politeness. You would address everyone, from the admiral of the fleet to your own younger brother or sister, as **SoH**.   
    
    
### ghaH versus 'oH
Klingon is similar to English, in that people are "he" or "she", but objects are all "it". (There are no feminine forks or masculine chairs or anything like that in either language.)   
    

Klingon simplifies this a bit further: **ghaH** is used for all "beings capable of using language" (Klingons, humans, etc.) regardless of whether they are male or female. It can be translated as either "he" or "she" (or "him" or "her" as an object).   
    

**'oH** "it" is used for other things: animals, plants, inanimate objects, etc.   
    

There may occasionally be nouns, for instance an andriod, for which it is difficult to determine if it is a "being capable of language". There is no correct answer for these and different people might use different pronouns.   
    

This division into "beings capable of using language" and "everything else" also comes into play in how to form plurals, as explained previously, and in possessive endings, which will be mentioned later.   
    

### chaH versus bIH
Klingon makes that same distinction in the plural. **chaH** is used for a group of beings capable of language and **bIH** for a group of inanimate objects (and animals etc.). A mixed group will most likely use **chaH bIH je**.
