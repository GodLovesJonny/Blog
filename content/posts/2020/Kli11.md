The verb suffix **-'a'** for a yes/no question and the verb suffix **-be'** for negative.   
    

The verb suffix **-'a'** is classified as a "type 9" verb suffix and will always be the last suffix on a verb.  The verb suffix **-be'** is classified as a "rover".   
    

These suffixes can be added to any verb to turn it into a negative or a question. For example, **jIQong** "I slept", **jIQongbe'** "I did not sleep", **jIQong'a'?** "did I sleep?"; **bIval** "you are smart", **bIvalbe'** "you are not smart", **bIval'a'?** "are you smart"?   
    

Even negative questions are possible: **valbe''a' torgh?** "Is Torg not smart?", **yItbe''a' mara?** "Didn't Mara walk?" (Note that the **-'a'** is placed after the **-be'** since it always comes last on the verb.)   
    

Note that the **-'a'** verb suffix is not used when there is a question word such as "who", "what", "where", "when", "why", or "how". It is only used to turn a statement into a yes/no question.
